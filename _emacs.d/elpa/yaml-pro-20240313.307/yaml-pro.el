;;; Commentary:

;; yaml-pro contains a new mode which provides conveniences when
;; editing YAML.  Running `yaml-pro-mode' switches the mode and the
;; following commands are available:
;; - `yaml-pro-move-subtree-up' and `yaml-pro-move-subtree-down'
;; - `yaml-pro-next-subtree' and `yaml-pro-prev-subtree',
;; - `yaml-pro-kill-subtree'
;; - `yaml-pro-up-level'
;; - `yaml-pro-fold-at-point' and `yaml-pro-unfold-at-point'.
;; - `yaml-pro-edit-scalar'
;; - `yaml-pro-jump' or if consult exists `yaml-pro-consult-jump'
